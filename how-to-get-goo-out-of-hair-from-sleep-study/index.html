First, take a warm bath and let your head soak in the water for a few minutes…get out and let a bunch of conditioner sit in your hair/scalp for an hour or so…or as @buttonstc mentioned hot oil (you can buy vo5 at your local drug store). Hair conditioner may help get the glue out of your hair. You might have to comb it out gentely.that is how i got the finger nail polish out of my daughters hair.
