This is magnified by thinning of the skin and by the fact that facial muscles continuously contract, particularly during periods of concentration or emotional arousal (stress), making wrinkles. In many cases, the reason a hairstyle ceases to look as good on you as you age is that these features have been gradually transforming and throw off the balance that was once created by the style.
