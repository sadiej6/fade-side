20 Best Shag Haircuts for Thin Hair that Add Body From therighthairstyles.com
If your hair is wavy or curly, adding layers to the hair will allow the shorter layers to curl more and will let you style the hair to add volume and give the appearance of more hair. If your hair is denser then you can have blunt layers that will make your hair look good. Layers tend to remove weight and can make hair look thinner. Thinning is more often than not for short haircuts, unlike layering which is also suited to long hair.
