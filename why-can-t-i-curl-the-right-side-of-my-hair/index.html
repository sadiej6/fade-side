CURLY TO STRAIGHT why can’t I get my ends right?😩 YouTube From youtube.com
It definitely curls better now, but it�s totally uneven. If your hair is not fully saturated with water when you apply your products, they will be unevenly distributed so that some sections of hair will curl, and others will fall flat, not clump, or frizz. My hair would come out of that towel and immediately get blasted by the hair dryer. I have pale skin with green eyes, and my hair is fine and frizzy, with an uneven natural curl that i straighten with a round.
