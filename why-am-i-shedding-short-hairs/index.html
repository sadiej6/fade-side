Hair shedding is actually a natural process and is more indicative of hair growth than hair loss, which is why increased shedding may occur when beginning an effective hair loss treatment such as propecia (finasteride) and rogaine (minoxidil). Hair shedding often stops on its own. Doing this will inevitably cause hair shedding. Most people lose 50 to 100 hairs per day as part of this natural cycle, more on days you wash your hair.
