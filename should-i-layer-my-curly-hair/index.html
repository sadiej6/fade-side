regular haircuts are VERY important to maintaining length From pinterest.com
I have waist length hair and i had no volume on the top of my hair, the length was just weighing it down so much my curls were being flattened. Usually, this is because they�ve either been botched in the past, or out of fear that if too much weight is removed then their hair will be big and puffy. Layers are a curl�s best friend. Layers are designed to help thin out excess thickness or help boost volume, depending on the fullness and thickness of your hair.
