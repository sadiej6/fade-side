12 Products That Won�t Weigh Down Your Natural Curls Allure From allure.com
Oils that have been known to work well with hair, like olive oil or jojoba oil, can elongate curls and weigh them down. But any hair type will benefit from a little bit of oil. My solution to this problem has been to blowdry my hair using the pixie curl method (i think that�s what it�s called), which basically means i scrunch sections of my hair onto the diffuser and then turn the hair drier on. When you wash your curly locks, shampoo and conditioner can weigh down the curls even more.
