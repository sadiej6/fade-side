How Often Should You Get A Haircut? (2021 Guide) From menshairstylestoday.com
If your hair is four inches long, get a haircut monthly, if the shortest part of your hair is eight inches long, head to the barber every eight weeks. If you are starting to get a bit fed up of how the hair looks after a couple of weeks then rotate your haircuts. Go with whatever frequency you. I’ve heard of guys with a close fade on the back and sides get a haircut weekly.
