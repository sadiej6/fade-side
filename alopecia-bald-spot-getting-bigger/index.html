Why am i getting small bald spots on my head? Anyway, 7 months later on finasteride, it�s far better and you can hardly see scalp when my hair is wet. For some people, however, the problem can last longer and be more severe, causing total baldness (alopecia totalis) or total loss of body hair (alopecia universalis). �the bald spots just kept getting bigger�.
