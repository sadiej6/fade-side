How To Easily Frame Hair Around The Face Using a Twist From youtube.com
If you start cutting into your beard before the slower growing hairs catch up, you’ll have uneven areas over time. Tip your head upside down, brush your hair forward and gather it into a nice tight, smooth, secure ponytail that sits on your hairline in the centre of your forehead. Investing in a good pair of scissors, flipping your head upside down, and trimming modestly are a few tips that will also help. Make sure that your head is hanging down lower than your neck, so that all of your hair is off your neck and hanging forward towards the ground.
