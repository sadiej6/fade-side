Nut job™ is a hair thickening fibre designed to cover up balding spots, especially at the crown. For fine hair you need to get a really dry cream that doesn�t weigh down the hair and thickens it up. It can take some effort to make thin hair appear thick enough to hide your scalp, but working with the right tools can help. Spikes are great for giving more texture to the haircut for men with thin hair and hiding all problematic spots.
