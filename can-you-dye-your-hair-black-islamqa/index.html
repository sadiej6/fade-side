How To Dye Your Hair Blonde At Home Lightening dark hair From pinterest.com
When you dye blonde hair black, however, your visible roots will look unnatural. Having to use bleach to lighten your strands before you can achieve your desired hair color can be a drag, not to mention damaging. If its already more than 3 weeks, you can apply black dye on the hair make sure to cover all the bleached areas, and if it’s less than 2 weeks after you bleached your hair, i would recommend you to wait for few more days to escape from the damage it causes. Note that color removers are gentler on your mane than a lighter like bleach.
