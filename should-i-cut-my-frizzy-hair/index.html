Let’s face it, a haircut could make or break your hair. If you have dry, frizzy hair a short haircut can do wonders for hair that is on the dryer or frizzier side, but it’s important to keep it on the longer side and avoid tons of short layers so that the hair can sit nicely without going poufy. If your hair is thick or coarse, reach for a rich treatment oil or crème. Frizzy hair, also called frizz, happens when the cuticle layer of each strand of your hair opens up, allowing the moisture from the air to pass through and swell all the strands.
