Does hair regrowth work? Stop Hair Loss &amp; Regrow Your From youtube.com
You might think it is not possible with anything less than a hair transplant but that simply is not true. If caught early, traction alopecia is usually reversible, and you can see new hair growth over time by changing the way you style your hair. In such cases, reversing hair loss may be as easy as adding foods rich in hair loss fighting nutrients to your daily diet. However, medications like finasteride and minoxidil can help you keep the hair you have and, in some cases, potentially regrow some of the hair you’ve lost due to male pattern baldness.
