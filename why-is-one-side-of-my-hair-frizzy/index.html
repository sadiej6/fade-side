Goddess of Curls // Spisha Hair styles, Curly hair From pinterest.fr
Have any of you guys encountered unruly curls at the temple, and if so, how do you make it look less flat and awkward (or flat and frizzy)? Before i actually realised it was curly (and i thought it was just frizzy) that straight section was my favourite part of my hair. I�ve used diffusers, gels, mousse, scrunching (never works) and giving up and blowing bit straight. I�ve noticed that no matter what i do, my face framing and curls on the side of my head are much curlier than the curls on the back of my head.
