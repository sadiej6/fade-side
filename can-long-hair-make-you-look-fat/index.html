Putting your hair through the heat styling and chemical processing ringer can make aging strands look older. The only other thing that you need is to make the long strands on the crown wavy and style by. Unfortunately, the cut can make you look older, as it draws attention to the neck, which tends to show early signs of aging, while the longer parts in the front of this cut tend to hit areas that show your age, like the forehead, eyes, and lower jaw. I still need to maintain it though, because more hair means its easier for it to get greasy and look like shit.
