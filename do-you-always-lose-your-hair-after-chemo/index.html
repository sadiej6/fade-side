When will my hair grow back after chemotherapy? YouTube From youtube.com
I lost my hair on my 2nd session of chemo, shed some tears more than my hair but it has started to grow back. If your hair is going to fall out, it usually begins within 2 to 4 weeks after treatment starts. But you’ll have an opportunity to try just about every hairstyle imaginable, so you might as well embrace it and make the best of each stage. Whether you lose hair depends upon the medication and dose your doctor prescribes.
