How To Train Rabbits To Be Friendly How to Leash Train From kawankelas-486.blogspot.com
Once your rabbits are more comfortable with you, you can try holding their food by your shoulder whilst sitting on the floor. Sit down on the floor (i like to lean on the sofa, since it helps with the whole ‘just casually chilling on the floor vibe’) and wait for your rabbit to approach you. Try not to pull away forcefully or to hit the rabbit because this could make the wound worse. Take time and follow the steps to train your cute pet rabbits and you can get a happy life for both of you.
