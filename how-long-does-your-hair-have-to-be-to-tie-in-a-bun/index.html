HAIR TUTORIAL MESSY BUN (ONLY 2 HAIR TIES REQUIRED) YouTube From youtube.com
Have only recently become able to put my hair in a bun/ponytail, and i am at around month 16, but i have cut my hair a couple times. Grab the hair in the ponytail and twist it tightly all the way to the tip of the hair. Then loosely twist the ponytail into a bun and secure it with a few bobby pins —but remember, the more tousled it looks the better. If you don’t already have long hair, we recommend growing out your locks so they’re at least 6 inches long.
