The Trick to Styling Your Bangs When You Have a Cowlick From byrdie.com
Hair cowlicks are caused by genetics and are typically located at the crown of your head. You’ll want to dry the hair with a brush pushing it in one direction, and then after a few strokes switch and brush the hair in the opposite direction, this will help “confuse” the hair, as to which way it is supposed to go. This is a good plan for people with short hair and cowlicks on the nape or crown. But in the case of balding, there is a loss of hair in a particular area on the head.
