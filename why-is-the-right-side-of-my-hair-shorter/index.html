Whys my hair so thin on the left side of my hairline? From pinterest.com
But i have been making a good effort to change it up and sleep on both sides evenly and i have been noticing some difference. My right side seems to be a 4b or maybe a little 3c and is much longer, while the left side is mostly a 4b and comes up short and inch or two. Check out your seatbelt and where it hits your hair and check out how your hair hits your purse when you put it on your shoulder. I mostly wear my purse on my right side, but because of my equilibrium, how my hair hangs, or some other reason whenever i wore it on my left side it was always on my hair.
