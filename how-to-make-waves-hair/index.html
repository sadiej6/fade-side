To make wavy hair curlier scrunch your hair while in the shower, and then diffuse instead of air dry so that it dries quicker and tighter. Use lightweight products to keep hair light. Put a washcloth in running hot water, squeeze some water from the rag, and then place the hot washcloth on top of your hair and wipe down. The look is achieved by the constant brushing of short hair, which forms ripples throughout the hair, creating a wave pattern.
