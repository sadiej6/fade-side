Sisterlocks and LocSoc Style!!!! Natural hair styles From pinterest.co.uk
With thin locs, your hair tends to look fuller with more volume, which is a plus for those with thin hair. Depending on the texture of your hair, it may not be able to hold a dread until it has reached about 7 cm (~3 inches). Relaxed hair makes it more difficult to loc to start because it�s so straight and like jjamiah stated would require a great deal of back combing and palm rolling. This is more common in ethnic hair types since the extra texture makes dreads in sections that small possible.
