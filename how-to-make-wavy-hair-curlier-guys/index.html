40&#43; Curly Hairstyles For Men 2021 Trends From menshairstyletrends.com
An excellent way to make your wavy hair look curlier is by scrunching. Waves are a type of curly hair but not everybody knows this. For years i used curling wands to spot treat the waves that were bent out of shape or refused to curl, but exposing your hair to heat will only make it less curly as heat damage leads to limp, shapeless hair. For those with wavy hair, the hair itself won�t be straight, but it will have a uniformed look with the same length all around.
