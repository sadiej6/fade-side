Side braids. Braids in 2020 Hair styles, Braided From pinterest.com
1 timothy 2:9 will condemn those who braid their hair. As you can see, makeup can serve many purposes, but when it comes to your personal relationship with god, it’s just that: I don�t think it is a sin to where your hair in a braid but when you are spending hours in the mirror and curling your hair trying to be attractive then it is a sin and back then at that time the bible was talking about the egyptions when they put there hair in a few braids on each side and also mixed jewls and gold into them. If you have the time to do this without avoiding something more important that you are neglecting to do this, there is no sin, no problem.
