How on Earth do you get long hair like this?? Would From reddit.com
Maybe it’s just the guys i know or maybe i’m wrong, but it seems to me like guys prefer long hair on women as opposed to short hair. Long hair = more feminine. despite evidence to the contrary, i still believe it depends more on style than length. The most curious thing is that women don�t really like to have very bright makeup, but they think that men like it, which is why they often do it. All of us know that girls go gaga over this great sex symbol of two centuries now.
