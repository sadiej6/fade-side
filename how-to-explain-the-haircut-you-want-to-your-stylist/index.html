How to Tell a Stylist You Hate Your Haircut Bad Haircut From goodhousekeeping.com
If your tresses tend to lie flat, tell your stylist you�d like layers if you want to create movement and volume by removing density. Instead of using vague words like “shorter” and “longer” (your version of shorter could be entirely different from your hairdresser), try being a little more descriptive, like indicating how many inches you’d like off, or whether you want a hard or soft cut. Embrace each stage—growing out a pixie haircut means at some point you’ll rock a bob, a lob and maybe even a shag. Avoid vague instructions like “i just want to cut the ends” or “a couple of inches off, please.” the more specific you are about the look you want, the more likely the stylist can achieve that look.
