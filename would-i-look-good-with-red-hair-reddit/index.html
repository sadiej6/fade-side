Go for golden, ashy tones. For years, the beauty rule of thumb to follow when it came to blonde hair was if you had blonde hair as a kid, you�ll likely look good with blonde hair as an adult. while it�s true that adults who were blonde as kids would look natural as blonde adults, pretty much everyone can look wear blonde hair. The brighter, bolder, more purposely “artificial looking” scarlet shades look best on medium to deeper skin tones with undertones of yellow.they can be too over powering on fair skin. I achieved the perfect shade of red hair with the help of my stylist.
