Long Hair in Middle Age Reader Comments The New York Times From nytimes.com
The amount of layers will depend on how thick or curly your hair is, but gently framing your face is flattering. I started wearing my hair down while exercising after reading an article in scientific american a few years ago, which found that cars gave a wider berth to bikers who had their hair down. Don’t apply too much of any one product and make sure that they rinse out completely otherwise your hair will end up looking dull. my hair always feels softer immediately after bleaching, doesn’t mean that’s good for it.
