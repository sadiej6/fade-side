Maybe it has to do with your curl type. Razor cuts can make curly hair frizzy (when your hair is shorter it becomes even curlier due to less weight pulling it down). Be aware however, that if your curly hair is long, the weight of the hair may have stretched out the curl of the hair nearer to the scalp area, and will give you the sense that the hair nearer the scalp is actually straighter. Thus, cutting from time to time will help keep your curls bouncing.
