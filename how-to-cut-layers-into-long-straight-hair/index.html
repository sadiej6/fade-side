Layered haircuts for long straight hair back view From latestfashiontips.com
Layering seeks to get rid of the triangle. Then, bend over and comb all your hair into a ponytail at the top of your head. To give yourself a layered haircut, start with clean, damp hair. Once your ponytail is neat and there are no bumps, loosen and pull the hair elastic down in front of your face so there are only a couple inches left in the ponytail.
